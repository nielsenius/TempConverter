# Lab 1: Temperature Converter and Unit Tests

Students will be asked to build a F to C temperature converter using the Swift language. Quick/Nimble unit tests will be provided. Students must write code to make these tests pass (test-driven development).

Areas of focus: writing functions, numerical operations, types (implicit and explicit typing), loops, conditionals
